# Music-Synthesizer--Karplus-Strong-Algorithm

Hardware implementation method
In this method we have used the Verilog language to implement the Karplus Strong algorithm. The verilog code was written based on the following block diagram.
block diagram

Delay line and filter were first implemented as independent modules.Later, these modules were put together in the main module.Noise burst was provided in the main module

The hardware implementation folder contains three folders Filter, Delay line and Main design and a file Play_Audio_from_txt.ipynb. Each folder contains two files,the design file and testbench file. The design file contains program for the design of the component and testbench contains code for the verification of that design.

Audio signal generated by the Verilog code is written to a text file. Using the ipynb file audio can be played from the text file.
